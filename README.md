# simulationTest
Masters project test

File overview:

Structure: Analysis.py is the main class, which can call Experiment.py, Experiment.py then calls the relevant simulation. In case of the thesis, only GroteMarkt.py is interesting.


Simulation-related: Simulation Classes, for implementing agents and such in the simulation. Also: GroteMarkt.py. CreateMap.py creates the simulation environment. Reporters.py creates the reporters.

BN are created in BN.py. Manually created networks in manualBNs.

Runtime instructions:
python3 Analysis.py

Automatically runs simulations of the experiment discussed in the thesis.
